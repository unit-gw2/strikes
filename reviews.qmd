Thank you UNIT for the LCM Cerus run. Everyone are friendly and nice ‚ù§Ô∏è  So smooth and very fast clear (~10 mins). 

P.S. English is not my mother tongue so my English is still pretty weak but my commander explained the process calmly (write while speaking) so it makes everything easier. I really highly recommend the UNIT team

## Harvest Temple CM - Voidwalker & Kaineng Overlook CM, 09.04.2024

Thanks for the run (HT and KO), all went perfectly (and it's always a pleasure to look at players so much better than me play hard content !)
Now I need to save for Cerus !

I know my stuff. These guys know it more. Legitimately the best 10 man execution I've ever seen. 
Bonus points for the memes, too. 
A+
