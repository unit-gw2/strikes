    "text": "Who are we?\nWe are dedicated players of the guild [UNIT] who love playing hard content. Across our team, we have multiple thousands of succesful Harvest Temple CM kills and (already) hundreds of Temple of Febe CM kills. We like to push ourselves to the limit and enjoy playing that content. Naturally, we expanded and started to offer services for strikes.\n\n\nWhat services can you get from us?\nWe mostly focus on Strikes Challenge Modes, since that’s what we enjoy most. Furthermore, we enjoy and fill a niche especially around the hardest strikes and associated achievements in the game: Harvest Temple and Temple of Febe. We also offer services for other strike CMs, in particular also infusion unlock services (e.g. Everbloom Infusion - EoD Strike CMs). Check out our prices here."

    "text": "FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. What services do you provide?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe provide any achievements related to Strike Missions, including everything from only Challenge Mode kills to individual achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. At what days/times are you running?\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually we run Thursday to Sunday at varying times between 19:30 and 23:30 CET/CEST. Exceptions are possible if those hours don’t work, simply ask in #🚀request-service, or via DM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How is payment handled?\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment is done upfront when the run starts. If multiple services are booked across different days, payment can be split per service for any given day. The only exception is if a service is booked a few days in advance; in that case we ask for a 5% deposit. We accept payment mostly in Mystic Coins and Antique Summoning Stones, but other types of payment can also be discussed. Just ask us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Do I need to do anything during the sell session?\n\n\n\n\n\nDepends on the service. Some achievements and clears without achievement require no action. In those cases you can simply /gg once the combat starts. But there are a few achievement that require you to participate in some way. This depends on the specific achievement in question. A detailed explanation for all services is given in #📝instructions and will also be explained briefly before the service starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. On what servers are you providing these services?\n\n\n\n\n\nServices are provided on European servers only. However, depending on the regional pricing from other groups, it might be cheaper if you transfer to EU, buy our service and then transfer back to your region. If you are interested in transfering, check out more details in #📝instructions, or ask us via #🚀request-service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. How do I request a service?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can go to #🚀request-service (a channel on our Discord server) and open a Ticket. We will then come back to answer any question, or handle scheduling as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nMore Questions? Simply ask us on Discord! ❤️"
