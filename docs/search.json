    "text": "Who are we?\nWe are dedicated players of the guild [UNIT] who love playing hard content. Across our team, we have multiple thousands of succesful Harvest Temple CM kills and (already) hundreds of Temple of Febe CM kills. We like to push ourselves to the limit and enjoy playing that content. Naturally, we expanded and started to offer services for strikes.\n\n\nWhat services can you get from us?\nWe mostly focus on Strikes Challenge Modes, since that’s what we enjoy most. Furthermore, we enjoy and fill a niche especially around the hardest strikes and associated achievements in the game: Harvest Temple and Temple of Febe. We also offer services for other strike CMs, in particular also infusion unlock services (e.g. Everbloom Infusion - EoD Strike CMs)."

    "text": "FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. For what stuff u can request us to do?\n\n\n\n\n\nAny achievements related to Strike Missions, including everything only Challenge Mode kills to individual achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Which days we usually will be running?\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday to Sunday at varying times between 19:30 and 23:30 CET/CEST. Exceptions are possible if those hours don’t work, simply ask in #🚀request-service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. How can you pay for your order?\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment is done upfront when the run starts. If multiple services are booked across different days, payment can be split per service for any given day. We accept payment mostly in mystic coins and antique summoning stones. Other types of payment can be discussed. The only exception is if the service is a few days in the future; in that case we ask for a 5% deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Do you have to do anything during the sell session?\n\n\n\n\n\nDepends on the service. Some achievements and clears without achievement require no action, but a few achievement require to participate in some mechanics. A detailed explanation for all services is given in #📝instructions and will also be explained briefly before the service starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. On what servers are we providing our services?\n\n\n\n\n\nServices are provided on European servers only. However, depending on the regional pricing from other groups, it might be cheaper if you transfer to EU, buy our service and then transfer back to your region. A detailed explanation will be given if that is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. I am from NA, but Harvest Temple CM services are too expensive! What can I do?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can save a good chunk of money by transfering to EU and buying our service. Even with the transfering costs, it is often cheaper than equivalent services on NA. Check the details in #📝instructions or ask us in #🚀request-service for detailed explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. How to request a service?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can go to #🚀request-service and open a Ticket. We will then come back to answer any question, or handle scheduling as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nMore Questions? Ask us via Discord! ❤️"
